# Mac Management Scripts
A collection of scripts to manage/install software on Macs

# OSX_Test_Menu

A script that allows you to select from a menu different administration tasks. At the time of this being written, Office 2016 needed to be manually installed from a local source. 

# Adobe Install

At the time of this being written, there was some confusion around whether or not all Macs deployed needed Adobe. The installs were too big for network installs, so this allows you to install from a local source such as a USB drive.
