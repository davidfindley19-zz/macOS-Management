# Mac Management Scripts
A collection of scripts to manage/install software on Macs

# OSX_Test_Menu

A script that allows you to select from a menu different administration tasks. At the time of this being written, Office 2016 needed to be manually installed from a local source. 

# Adobe Install

At the time of this being written, there was some confusion around whether or not all Macs deployed needed Adobe. The installs were too big for network installs, so this allows you to install from a local source such as a USB drive. 

# NFS_Software_Install

This was a test script written to see if we could store all software on a centralized repo and have it install. This centralized repo is Windows based and mounts it as such.

# JAMF_UPDATE

This was written to help with the enrollment process of the Macs in our environment. Some older machines don't check in as quickly as needed. This allows us to keep an always updated install of the JAMF package on a network location and manually install/policy updates.
